    <!-- Chosen Palette: Warm Neutrals -->
    <!-- Application Structure Plan: A two-panel, master-detail layout. The left panel serves as a sticky navigation list of all terms. Clicking a term dynamically updates the right content panel with that term's detailed definition. This structure was chosen for its high usability, allowing users to quickly jump between definitions without scrolling, which is far more efficient for a glossary or reference-style content than a linear document. -->
    <!-- Visualization & Content Choices: The report content is purely textual definitions. Goal: Inform. Presentation: A styled list for navigation (HTML/Tailwind) and structured text blocks for content (HTML/Tailwind). Interaction: JavaScript onClick events on the navigation list to control the visibility of content panels. A new "Download PDF" button uses jsPDF to generate a document from the source data. This is a classic, intuitive pattern for this type of data, superior to any chart or complex visualization. Library/Method: Vanilla JS, jsPDF. -->
    <!-- CONFIRMATION: NO SVG graphics used. NO Mermaid JS used. -->

                    explanation: 'Musical Instrument Digital Interface (MIDI) is a communication standard that allows digital musical instruments, computers, and other related devices to connect and communicate. It does not transmit an audio signal, but rather sends event messages, such as the pitch and intensity of a musical note, or control signals for parameters like volume and vibrato. This protocol enables a single person to build a complex studio setup or for different instruments to be layered together seamlessly.'

                    explanation: 'MP3 stands for MPEG Audio Layer 3. It is a digital audio encoding format that utilizes a form of lossy data compression. This compression algorithm significantly reduces the size of audio files while aiming to maintain a sound quality that is close to the original uncompressed audio. Its efficiency in file size made it a revolutionary format for the storage, distribution, and playback of digital music, fundamentally changing the music industry.'

                    explanation: 'DVD stands for Digital Versatile Disc or Digital Video Disc. It is an optical disc data storage format that was invented and developed in 1995. DVDs offer a significantly higher storage capacity than compact discs (CDs) of the same physical dimensions, making them ideal for storing video programs, software, and other large computer files. The format was widely adopted for consumer video distribution, replacing the VHS tape.'

The term also refers to the family of digital media standards they have created. These standards, such as MPEG-2 and MPEG-4, make it possible to compress large video and audio files into smaller sizes, which is crucial for broadcasting, streaming over the internet, and storage on devices like DVDs.'
